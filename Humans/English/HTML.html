		Cookies are minimal text files that contain small amounts of data. They are transferred from our servers to your device through your web browser or app. Your web browser or app then sends these small text files back to us whenever you access our services.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		These cookies do not necessarily contain any personal or identifying information. They are, however, commonly used to store a unique identifier for every individual user, so that our servers do not lose information on who you are while you are moving through the individual parts of our services.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		We may use cookies and similar technologies, such as “Web Storage” (specifically “localStorage”) and “Internal Storage”, to make interactions with our services more convenient, efficient and secure. For example, we may use these technologies to keep you signed in and to remember your preferences with regard to our services.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		As such, cookies and the related technologies are essential for the operation of our services. You therefore consent to our use of cookies and related technologies when using our services. Without these technologies, use of our services would not be reasonably possible.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		Your web browser or operating system usually provides means to delete such data currently stored on your device. They may even provide methods to disable the use of such technologies completely. You are welcome to make use of these settings and features of your web browser or operating system, but that may prevent our services from working correctly for you. For more information on how to delete such data currently stored on your device, please refer to the manual or help section of your web browser or operating system.

		<strong>
			Mandatory disclosure
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Laws in the jurisdictions that we operate in may obligate us to disclose certain personal information or other information that we collect about our users to local law enforcement authorities.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		We may be compelled to such disclosure in response to a court order, a warrant or a similar request by a judicial body or a government agency, or when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our rights or property, that of any third party, or the safety of the general public.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		In any case, we will provide data only to the extent necessary to satisfy the request, and, whenever possible and legally permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify affected users of any such disclosure.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<strong>
			Retention and deletion of data
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		We will retain certain pieces of personal information for as long as you use our services, as long as your account exists, or as long as needed for us to be able to provide our services to you.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		If you would like to cancel your use of our services, delete your account, or delete your personal information, you may do so in the respective sections of our services. If you need help, please contact us. See further below for our contact information.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		In order to prevent loss of data due to human errors or system failures, we keep additional backup copies of data, as most companies and service providers do, which may include some of your personal information. This means that parts of your personal information may temporarily remain on our servers even after deletion or termination of your use of our services.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		We may retain and use your personal information and data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our rights and agreements.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<strong>
			Service providers, contractors and agents
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		From time to time, we may share some information we have collected from you, including personal information, with a limited number of third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, resellers, agents or business partners, solely for the purpose of performing certain functions on our behalf.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		Such third parties help us provide and improve our services. Functions performed by them on our behalf may include payment processing, network data transmission, fraud prevention, customer support management and similar services.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		These third parties do not have any right to use the information that we share about you beyond what is necessary to assist us with the specific task at hand.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<strong>
			International data transfers
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Some of our external service providers and recipients of personal data are based outside your country and outside our country. This means that the processing of your personal data by those third parties involves an international transfer of your data to a third country. Such third countries may have data protection rules that are different from those in your or our country.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		Thus, for any international transfer of data, we ensure that appropriate technical, organizational and contractual measures are in place to guarantee that a similar degree of protection is afforded to your data internationally and that your personal data remains protected to the standards described in this policy.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<strong>
					We verify that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
				</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				The country of the recipient has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
			</dd>
			<dd>
				The recipient is certified as part of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.
			</dd>
			<dd>
				Standard Contractual Clauses, as adopted by or approved by the European Commission, are in place.
			</dd>
			<dd>
				The recipient has Binding Corporate Rules that guarantee the protection of personal data.
			</dd>
		</dl>
	</dd>
	<dd>
		Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms used by us when transferring your personal data internationally.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<strong>
			Mergers and acquisitions
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		If we are involved in a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of our business or assets, your information will likely be among the assets transferred.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		If any such change of ownership happens, the organization receiving your personal information will have to respect the promises that we have made in any pre-existing privacy policy such as this one.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		You will be notified via a prominent notice within our services or by email to the primary email address specified in your account at least 30 days before any such transfer of your personal information. This notification will include help on choices you may have regarding the transfer and treatment of your personal information.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<strong>
			How we secure your information
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		We take the trust that you place in us very seriously. We have therefore implemented all measures reasonably necessary to protect the personal information of our users from unauthorized access, modification, deletion, disclosure or other misuse.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the data submitted to us, both during transmission and after we have received it, and continue to expand our protections as becomes necessary with changing technology.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		In particular, all connections to and from our services are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) technologies.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		However, please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no method of electronic transmission or storage is perfectly secure and no measures can guarantee absolute security. Hardware or software failure as well as other factors may compromise the security of user information, as is the case with all other providers of digital services.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		Apart from that, please recognize that protecting your personal information is, in other parts, also your own responsibility. Especially, you are responsible for safeguarding any passwords and other authentication information that you use to access our services, as well as limiting physical access to the devices used.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		You should never disclose your authentication information to any third party and you should notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<strong>
			Links to external websites, applications and products
		</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Some parts and sections of our services may contain external links to websites, applications or products owned by and operated by third parties.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		We advise you to verify the privacy practices of those third parties individually. We have no knowledge about and are not responsible for the way that those third parties handle any personal information which you provide to them yourself.
	</dd>
	<dd>
		We encourage you not to provide any personal information to those third parties before assuring yourself of proper privacy practices on their part.
